As a Data and Financial Analyst, I bring a unique blend of academic rigor from UC Berkeley's Financial Technology Boot Camp and hands-on project experience in data and financial analysis. Skilled in Python, Pandas, SQL, and AWS, my expertise extends to blockchain technologies, especially Ethereum smart contracts and Solidity. Through hands-on projects, I have developed competencies in quantitative analysis, algorithmic trading, machine learning, AI, and financial modeling. These skills empower me to effectively navigate and innovate within complex financial systems.

My journey in FinTech is marked by a dedication to merging technology with finance, aiming to drive efficiency and strategic insights in fast-paced financial settings. I am actively seeking opportunities in the FinTech industry to apply my blend of academic learning and professional experience in shaping the future of financial technology.

I am open to collaborative projects, connections, and discussions that could lead to meaningful impact in shaping the future of the FinTech industry.
